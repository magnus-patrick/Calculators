# The Calculators

📊 Calculator 1 can do statistics operations with a dataset. It can calculate the mean, standard deviation, the median, and the mode!

♾️Calculator 2 can do calculus operations, namely summation, derivatives, integrals (definite & indefinite), and limits. It can also do algebra and graph functions!

- SciPy
 "SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems."

- NumPy
  "Nearly every scientist working in Python draws on the power of NumPy. NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant."

- SymPy
  "SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python."

- Matplotlib
  "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible."
